# SG-TREASURE — The Four Foundations (v1.0)
**Date:** 2025-11-06 03:26  
**Owner:** Nicolas E. Santiago — SAFEWAY GUARDIAN  
**License:** SG Treasure License  
**Security Class:** Public

## 1) Identity
- **SG_ID:** SG-TZ-0002
- **Name:** The Four Foundations
- **Type:** Doctrine / Governance Asset
- **Category:** Core Governance
- **Subcategory:** Spiritual / Societal

## 2) Purpose
Define the four relational pillars that support every human in the SAFEWAY GUARDIAN worldview and guide how the system serves, protects, and uplifts people.

## 3) Foundations
| Foundation | Essence | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Mother** | Source of life, nurture | The heart and emotional anchor of the user |
| **Agency** | Structure, authority | Public & private institutions supporting life and safety |
| **Family / Company** | Community, work | Social + economic living structure |
| **User** | Individual being | Receives protection + participates in growth |

## 4) Core Principles
1. Every person is connected to the Four Foundations.  
2. SI (Safeway Intelligence) supports these foundations equally.  
3. Balance among them creates stability.  
4. Weakness in one requires support from the others.  
5. Protection and service flow through all four toward the individual.

## 5) Layering in SG Ecosystem
```
Four Foundations  ->  SAFeway Intelligence (governs)  ->  SAFEWAY GUARDIAN (executes)
                        -> Modules/Algorithms/Apps (TRINITY, EAGLE EYE, QG-NEURO-FABRIC, AFA/BoA, etc.)
```

## 6) Interfaces
This is a doctrine asset (no technical APIs). Influence appears as policies in TRINITY AI, HISM/HISO/HISS, and SG-CODE governance.

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- **Misinterpretation** → Clear definitions, diagrams, translations.
- **Cultural variance** → Provide localized examples.
- **Loss of meaning** → Archive versioned documents in SG-TREASURES.

## 8) Roadmap
- v1.0: Core definition (this file)  
- v1.1: A4 infographic + concept diagram  
- v1.2: Integration notes for TRINITY AI policies  
- v1.3: Social use‑cases and education materials
